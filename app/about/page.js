      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        I am Matthew Martin, a Master&apos;s Civil Engineering student at the University of Nottingham. Currently in my fourth and final year, I have developed a keen passion for structural engineering and infrastructure projects.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My interest in civil engineering was formed early, inspired by my grandfather&apos;s own career in the profession. I aim to contribute to sustainable construction projects while gaining a broad range of civil engineering experiences.
