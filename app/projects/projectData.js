    img: "/images/Y3_BridgePractice.png",
    content: `As part of an optional module, I attended a residential week at the Constructionarium, where we were tasked with building a full-scale concrete pedestrian footbridge. In my role as Formwork Leader, I planned, organised, and constructed all formwork for the project. I also gained learning experiences working alongside the surveying, reinforcement, and waste management teams, broadening my practical understanding of the construction process. Through this time, I gained valuable insight into working under increasing time pressure and collaborating effectively within my team and across a range of disciplines.`,

    desc: "Construction design project involving the planning of structural layouts, earthworks, drainage and timeline of an art gallery.",
    img: "/images/Y3_ArtGallery.png",
    content: `This project involved adapting a given architectural model, where our group of six was tasked with planning and virtually testing every aspect of the design phase. I played a key role in using Revit to design and iterate the concrete column layout, as well as carrying out calculations for retaining structures and producing quantity take-offs with detailed project costings. This was a 13-week coursework project during which I significantly improved my skills and understanding of Building Information Management. It also helped me develop the ability to coordinate effectively with my group in a shared digital environment.`,

    title: "Year 2 Halls of Residence Project",
    desc: "A steel design project exploring architectural design and innovative structural solutions within our group-developed layout.",
    img: "/images/Y2_Halls2.png",
    content: `This 32-week project was my first real experience of the full design process. It involved creating an architectural design to given specifications and produce a steel structure to support it. Our work included accounting for wind, snow, and impact loads, as well as designing steel connections and a culvert detail. I contributed significantly to the structural aspects of the main building, the selection of road surface and drainage systems, and produced graphic representations of multiple design details. Over the course of the year, I developed my communication skills and learned how to support team members with varying strengths and abilities.`,
